**TipEasy** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Li Chai**

Time spent: **More than 18** hours spent in total 

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [Y] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [Y] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [Y] UI animations 
* [Y] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [Y] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

- The video walkthrough didn't tell us to embed navigation controller, and that might have caused a trouble when I was trying to push segue from ViewController to SettingsViewController. 
- Many times the solution wasn't that hard to figure out, but I resort to endless searches which made problems more complicated...
- I had trouble on putting background image. It turned out I need to add the images set into Asset Catalogs. (Not just put them in the folder)
